# How to run and info about project

- Before you start run `npm install` first. After that `npm run start` or `ng serve` helps you run the application.

- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Side Notes:

- Main branch covers API request and rendering on the dashboard.
- To see bonus question you can navigate to `feature/shared-state` branch.
- Thanks to my ultimate design skills I added some coloring to squares going from red to blue (note form a developer who cannot decide color codes therefore generate it programmatically :D )
